# Covid Essentials

![Covid Essentials](./static/logo.png)

**Covid Essentials** is a community-driven platform developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people in need by connecting them with essential resources like food, medicine, water, and more. This project empowers NGOs and government agencies to efficiently provide assistance by mapping the locations of individuals requiring help.

## Overview

### Features

- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Ensures secure access for users and NGOs using OTP.
- **Request Upload**: Users can upload their requirements (food, medicine, water, etc.).
- **Interactive Map**: Pinpoints the locations of those in need, making it easier for NGOs and government agencies to respond.
- **Resource Management**: Categorizes resources for efficient distribution.

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: Users sign up and authenticate using two-factor authentication for secure access.
2. **Requirement Upload**: Authenticated users upload their needs (e.g., food, medicine, water).
3. **Mapping Requests**: The platform pins the userâ€™s location on an interactive map.
4. **Resource Allocation**: NGOs and government bodies access the map to identify and assist users in their vicinity.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (likely Leaflet.js for maps)
- **Database**: CSV for initial data
- **Authentication**: Two-Factor Authentication using OTP
- **Third-party Services**: Firebase for various services, Textlocal for SMS
